Introduction to CSS -  For me, understanding CSS was a difficult idea. My understanding of the CSS Cascade, which is an algorithm that specifies how user agents mix property values coming from several sources, took a long time to develop. But now that I've finished the Khan Academy course, I'm more assured in my ability to practise CSS programming and implementation.



I've signed up for an online crash course with a virtual instructor to further my CSS education. There, I'll learn additional CSS ideas like the advanced CSS collection of tools and approaches that aid in building the cutting-edge websites that prospective companies and clients seek. You can more easily make websites responsive using these skills. Making buttons with CSS is a concept I'm eager to understand. Here is a CSS module that I worked on:

Introdcution to Java Script - I had never attempted to learn Javascript or code before for the simple reason that when I first started coding and programming, I wasn't exposed to it and didn't know enough about it. However, I waited till I took computer science this semester after learning from a fellow student that Grade 12 will teach us Javascript. After completing the highly educational and satisfying Khan Academy course on Java Scirp, I've recently started taking on little, sporadic JS projects to practise writing JS code. The JS module I worked on for Khan Academy is shown here:
